To address this gap, we present MusiLingo, a novel system for music caption generation and music-related query responses. MusiLingo employs a single projection layer to align music representations from the pre-trained frozen music audio model MERT (CITATION) with a frozen LLM, bridging the gap between music audio and textual contexts. We train it on an extensive music caption dataset and fine-tune it with instructional data. Due to the scarcity of high-quality music Q\&A datasets, we created the MusicInstruct (MI) dataset from captions in the MusicCaps datasets, tailored for open-ended music inquiries. Empirical evaluations demonstrate its competitive performance in generating music captions and composing music-related Q\&A pairs. Our introduced dataset enables notable advancements beyond previous ones.},

We put forward the topic of music question and answer based on aesthetic experience to help people understand music more comprehensively. We summarized the relevant external characteristics of music elements that people are most concerned about in the field of music analysis, and generated a structured music aesthetic experience database. Based on this, we constructed the AMQA-dataset. We propose a new method of music graph representation, which can improve the reasonability and interpretability of music question answering system. We have verified our idea on the AMQA dataset, and achieved experimental results comparable to those of humans.},
