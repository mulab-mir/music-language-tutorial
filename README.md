## About the Authors

[*SeungHeon Doh*](https://seungheondoh.github.io/) is a Ph.D. Candidate at the Music and Audio Computing Lab, KAIST, under the guidance of Juhan Nam. His research focuses on conversational music description, retrieval, and generation. SeungHeon has published papers related to music \& language models at ISMIR, ICASSP and IEEE TASLP. He aims to enable machines to comprehend diverse modalities during conversations, thus facilitating the understanding and discovery of music through dialogue. SeungHeon has interned at Chartmetric, NaverCorp, and ByteDance, applying his expertise in real-world scenarios.

[*Ilaria Manco*](https://ilariamanco.com/) is a PhD student at the Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music (Queen Mary University of London), under the supervision of Emmanouil Benetos, George Fazekas, and Elio Quinton (UMG). Her research focuses on multimodal deep learning for music information retrieval, with an emphasis on audio-and-language models for music understanding. Her contributions to the field have been published at ISMIR and ICASSP and include the first captioning model for music and representation learning approaches to connect music and language. Previously, she was a research intern at Google DeepMind, Adobe and Sony and obtained an MSci in physics from Imperial College London. 

[*Zachary Novack*](https://zacharynovack.github.io/) is a Ph.D. Student at the University of California -- San Diego, where he is advised by Julian McAuley and Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick. His research is primarily aimed at efficient and controllable music and audio generation. Specifically, Zachary seeks to build generative music models that allow for flexible musically-salient controls, while accelerating such models so that they can be used in practical production workflows. Zachary has interned at Stability AI and Adobe Research, contributing such works as DITTO-(1/2) and Presto!. Outside of academics, Zachary is passionate about music education and teaches percussion in the southern California area.

[*Jong Wook Kim*](https://jongwook.kim/) is a Member of Technical Staff at OpenAI where he has worked on multimodal deep learning models such as Jukebox, CLIP, Whisper, and GPT-4. He has published at ICML, CVPR, ICASSP, IEEE SPM, and ISMIR, and he co-presented a tutorial on self-supervised learning at the NeurIPS 2021 conference. He completed a Ph.D. in Music Technology at New York University with a thesis focusing on automatic music transcription, and he has an M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He interned at Pandora and Spotify during the Ph.D. study, and he worked as a software engineer at NCSOFT and Kakao.

[*Ke Chen*](https://www.knutchen.com/) is a Ph.D. Candidate in the department of computer science and engineering at University of California San Diego. His research interests span across the music and audio representation learning, with a particular focus on its downstream applications of music generative AI, audio source separation, multi-modal learning, and music information retrieval. He has interned at Apple, Mitsubishi, Tencent, Bytedance, and Adobe, to further explore his research directions. During his PhD study, Ke Chen has published more than 20 papers in top-tier conferences in the fields of artificial intelligence, signal processing, and music, such as AAAI, ICASSP, and ISMIR. Outside of academics, he indulges in various music-related activities, including piano performance, singing, and music composition.
