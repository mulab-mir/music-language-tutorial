Evaluation of music description systems 

## Match-based metrics
Borrowing from the computer vision and NLP literature, music captioning is typically evaluated through a set of automatic metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE and, more recently, BERT-score.

## Other types of automatic evaluation
* Multiple-choice question answering
* LLM-as-a-judge
